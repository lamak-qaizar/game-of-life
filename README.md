Understanding the 4 Rules of Simple Design by Corey Haines

## Constraints applied

- TDD
- Object Calisthentics
- Polymorphism (Subclassing, Strategy, Null-Object Pattern)

## Commit notation

- r (provable refactor)
- b (bug fix)
- F (feature add)
- !!! (risky refactoring)
- t (test code only)
- a (automatic reformatting)
