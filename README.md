# Conway's Game of Life

This kata has been attempted as a pre-req to reading **Understanding the 4 Rules of Simple Design** _by Corey Haines_.

## Constraints

- TDD
- Object Calisthenics
- Cyclomatic complexity (~1)

## Tool to calculate Cyclomatic Complexity

https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/93-metricsreloaded

Current complexity: 1.02 _(1 IF check exists in Cell creation method)_

## Commit notation

- r (provable refactor)
- b (bug fix)
- F (feature add)
- !!! (risky refactoring)
- t (test code only)
- a (automatic reformatting)
